        <h3>While "true" tea typically refers to black and green teas, there are a wide variety of other teas, including oolong tea and white tea, along with a whole host of tea beverages around the world. As a group, these beverages may not have much in common with each other, but they are all refered to as tea or derived from tea, and so I feel they should be listed here as well.

            <li>Mate (although unrelated to camellia sinensis, mate also has naturally occuring caffeine)</li>
