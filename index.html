        <h1>Welcome to the Wonderful World of Tea!</h1>
        </div>

        <p>I cannot remember the first cup of tea I ever drank, but I do know that it quickly became an integral part of my life. Tea can energize or soothe you, warm you up or cool you off, comfort you when you are sick or introduce you to new and exciting flavors. I hope this information can be useful to someone on their own tea journey, and if you like my perspectives, you can find my favorite tea order hidden in the website!

        <p>The Encyclopedia Brittanica states that tea is a "beverage produced by steeping in freshly boiled water the young leaves and leaf buds of the tea plant, Camellia sinensis. Two principal varieties are used, the small-leaved China plant (C. sinensis variety sinensis) and the large-leaved Assam plant (C. sinensis variety assamica). Hybrids of these two varieties are also grown. The leaves may be fermented or left unfermented."

        <h3>The history of tea:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Tea was first grown and used as a beverage in ancient China almost 5,000 years ago.</li>
            <li>In roughly 300 AD tea becomes a common beverage for daily consumption in China.</li>
            <li>Around 1,000 years ago tea arrives in Japan, and a Japanese tea culture emerges that is ditinct from the tea culture in China.</li>
            <li>In the 1800's a different form of tea is discovered in the Indian subcontinent.</li>
            <li>The Dutch East India Company (and later the British East India Company) begin to trade tea around the world as colonialism rises.</li>
            <li>By the twentieth century, tea is being grown, processed, and consumed in almost every part of the world.</li>
            <li>Different types of tea and the ways in which they are prepared reflect their places of origin, and learning more about the history of these beverages can be fascinating.</li>
